# Breadcrumbs
daily breadcrumbs? (play with unity6)
- day1: outline image
- day2: sdf in texture.. :P
- day3: 2d dungeon generation
- day4: jumping in day3 :P
- day5: animation setting practice (It's so bad and a mess >_<)
- day6: need own tiles! practice with tilemap... oh well it's a mess.. ha!

음~ 고민중~
